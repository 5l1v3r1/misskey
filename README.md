# misskey

This is a simple Desktop typing test which starts over every time the typist makes a mistake. I was motivated to make this after seeing my friend try to type in Dvorak&mdash;he makes frequent mistakes instead of actually *learning* where the keys are.

# Implementation

The current implementation of *misskey* is written in Go with [gogui](https://github.com/unixpickle/gogui) for its interface. The test sentences and keyboard layout are hard-coded and generic.
